# Python Hello World ‚Äì Basic Printing and String Manipulation

This project focuses on fundamental **Python programming concepts** such as printing, string manipulation, and working with variables.  
It contains small programs that demonstrate the use of the `print()` function, string slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

## üìå Learning Objectives
- Use the `print()` function to display output in Python.  
- Apply string formatting and f-strings.  
- Perform string slicing and concatenation.  
- Work with variables to manipulate and display data.  
- Follow coding constraints such as line limits and avoiding loops when not required.
