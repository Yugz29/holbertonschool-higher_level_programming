# Python If/Else, Loops, and Functions ‚Äì Basic Control Structures

Welcome to this project focused on fundamental **Python programming concepts**, including variables, conditional statements, loops, and basic functions.  
This repository contains programs demonstrating the use of conditionals (`if`, `else`), loops (`for`), and functions to control program flow and manipulate data.

## üìå Learning Objectives
- Understand and use variables in Python.  
- Implement conditional statements (`if`, `else`) for decision-making.  
- Use loops (`for`) for repetitive tasks.  
- Create simple Python functions to perform calculations or process data.  
- Apply string formatting and ASCII manipulation without using built-in shortcuts.
